ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Luca, a French dev.
- I love making stuff, and I use that to learn as much as I can.
- Right now I'm working on [Hoonn.eu](https://www.hoonn.eu) amongst other things.
- To make stuff faster I love fully managed solutions, like Firebase, or Vercel hosting: ![Gotta go fast](https://media.giphy.com/media/yXVO50FJIJMSQ/giphy.gif)
